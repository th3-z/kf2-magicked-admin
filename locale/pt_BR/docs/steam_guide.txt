# KF2 Magicked Admin - Dedicated Server Tool [0.1.4]

Scripted management, statistics, and bot for ranked Killing Floor 2 servers. Provides in-game commands, player stat tracking and ranking, live welcome screen scoreboard and stats, greeter, and admin functions. Running entirely through the web admin, it does not affect a server's ranked/custom status. It can be ran either directly on the server or remotely, and manage multiple servers at once.

## Downloads
The latest version as of writing is '[b]0.1.4[/b]', released on the 29th of September 2019. A Windows executable is provided for this release [url=https://github.com/th3-z/kf2-magicked-admin/releases/download/0.1.4/kf2-magicked-admin-0.1.4.zip]here[/url].

For Linux and Mac OS it is recommended to run the program from Python sources since you likely already have it installed. The source for '[b]0.1.4[/b]' is available [url=https://github.com/th3-z/kf2-magicked-admin/archive/0.1.4.zip]here[/url]. You just need to install the requirements with '[b]pip3 install -r requirements.txt[/b]' and run it with '[b]python3 -O magicked_admin/magicked_admin.py[/b]'.

Development versions and build instructions are available on GitHub [url=https://github.com/th3-z/kf2-magicked-admin]here[/url].

[b]Note[/b]: If you want to use Magicked Admin on an endless or weekly mode server there is an extra step that you have to do which I talk about in the "Endless and weekly game mode support" section.

[h1]Running[/h1]
[olist]
[*]Extract '[b]kf2-magicked-admin-0.1.4.zip[/b]' anywhere you like.

[*]Double click the executable file

[*]You will be guided through the first time setup

[b]Note[/b]: If you want to re-run the first time setup, just delete the file '[b]conf/magicked_admin.conf[/b]'
[/olist]

[h1]Running with Docker[/h1]

A Docker image is also available. Running with docker is easy, just issue the following command.
[code]docker run -it -p 1880:1880 --name kf2-magicked-admin -v '<host config folder location>':'/magicked_admin/conf' th3z/kf2-magicked-admin[/code]

You will need to change '[b]<host config folder location>[/b]' to wherever you want to store your config folder. '[b]/mnt/user/appdata/kf2-magicked-admin[/b]' is a popular choice for systems running Unraid.

After this command runs the container will exit out and the logs will tell you to setup the config file. Go to your '[b]conf[/b]' folder and set things up, then run the container again and you are good to go!

## Commands
In the following sections I will describe all the commands. However there are some general things to note that apply to them all.

When inputting commands into the chat they need to be prefixed with '[b]![/b]'. When writing commands into a script, or chaining them the '[b]![/b]' should be omitted.

Many commands will look for closest matches to their parameters. For example '[i]biotics[/i]' will match '[i]kf-biotics-lab[/i]' and 'userO' will match '[i]userOne™/@:®[/i]'.

All commands have in-game help text that can be accessed with the '[b]-h'[/b] flag.
[list]
[*] Example: '[b]!commands -h'[/b]
[/list]
All commands also have the following flags.
[list]
[*] Option '[b]-q[/b]': Suppresses output
[*] Option '[b]-p[/b]': Pads output to hide the username line
[/list]
Escape sequences as follows are available to format messages.
[list]
[*] '[b]\n[/b]' - Newline
    - Example: '[b]!say line 0 \n line 1[/b]'

[/list]

## Welcome screen leaderboards
Writing a '[b]conf/server_name.motd[/b]' file containing pairs of '[b]%PLR[/b]' and '[b]%SCR[/b]' will allow you to render live leaderboard on the welcome screen.

A simple example could be as follows.
[code]Welcome to our server.

%SRV_K Zeds killed on this server.

Top Players (total kills):
1. %PLR [%SCR]		2. %PLR [%SCR]		3. %PLR [%SCR] 
4. %PLR [%SCR]		5. %PLR [%SCR]		6. %PLR [%SCR] 
7. %PLR [%SCR]		8. %PLR [%SCR]		9. %PLR [%SCR]

Have fun and good luck!
[/code]

KF2 Magicked Admin will replace '[b]%PLR[/b]' with the player's username, '[b]%SCR[/b]' with the player's total kills or total dosh, '[b]%SRV_K[/b]' with the global server kills, and '[b]%SRV_D[/b]' with the global server dosh.

Once the file is written, use the '[b]!update_motd <type>[/b]' command to refresh the leaderboard. This should be used in combination with '[b]!start_tc <refresh_interval>[/b]' so that it is refreshed automatically.
    - Example: '[b]!start_tc 300 -- update_motd dosh[/b]'

The metric for '[b]%SCR[/b]' can be either 'kills', 'time', or 'dosh'. This is can be set by changing the '[b]<type>[/b]' parameter when using '[b]!update_motd <type>[/b]'

Here is my survival suicidal welcome screen as an example of what can be achieved. 

[previewicon=12055995;sizeOriginal,inline;KFGame_2018-04-14_03-27-00.png][/previewicon]


[h1]Notes[/h1]
[list]
[*] This will overwrite your existing motd.
[*] '[b]!reload_motd[/b]' Can be used to reload the template file while KF2 Magicked Admin is still running.
[/list]

## Scripts
KF2 Magicked Admin has some rudimentary scripting support which can be used to chain commands into a single action.

There are two categories of scripts, they differ in when and how they are executed.

[list]
[*] Comments can be added to scripts by prefixing a line with '[b];[/b]'
[/list]

[h1]Init scripts[/h1]

Writing a '[b]server_name.init[/b]' in the '[b]conf/scripts[/b]' folder with a series of commands will run the commands in sequence when the bot starts on '[b]server_name[/b]'. The server names are defined in '[b]conf/magicked_admin.conf[/b]', if you haven't changed the name it will default to '[b]server_one[/b]'.

An example init file will have been generated on first launch, this can be used as a template for writing your own init scripts.

[h1]Run scripts[/h1]

The '[b]!run[/b]' command exists to facilitate the running of scripts at any time. These scripts should be placed in the '[b]conf/scripts[/b]' folder. An example script is already in the scripts folder, it can be ran with '[b]!run example[/b]'. 

These scripts are formatted much the same as the init script, the commands will be ran in sequence from top to bottom.

[h1]Notable examples[/h1]

Some commands are particularly useful when used in scripts, these are: '[b]!start_tc[/b]', '[b]!start_trc[/b]', '[b]!start_wc[/b]', '[b]!start_jc[/b]', '[b]!top_wave_kills[/b]', '[b]!top_wave_dosh[/b]', '[b]!enforce_dosh[/b]', '[b]!say[/b]'.

'[b]conf/scripts/server_one.init[/b]' - [i]Show who earned the most dosh each wave when the trader opens, and update the welcome screen leaderboard every 5 minutes[/i]
[code] start_trc -- top_wave_dosh
 start_tc 300 -- update_motd dosh[/code]

'[b]conf/scripts/server_one.init[/b]' - [i]Advertise your Steam group when the boss wave is reached[/i]
[code] start_wc -w -1 -- say Join our steam group: http://our.steam/group[/code]

'[b]conf/scripts/server_one.init[/b]' - [i]Provide basic bot usage guidance to players[/i]
[code] start_tc -rt 800 -- say I'm a bot, type !commands to see available commands[/code]

'[b]conf/scripts/priv_game[/b]' - [i]Setup a private lobby with a single command[/i]
[code]silent -q
password --set superSecretPassword
difficulty hell
length long
load_map biotics
silent -q[/code]

## Configuration options
Basic setup is done on the first run. However this is only to get you started, it does not cover all of the options KF2 Magicked Admin can offer. Please see the configuration file, '[b]conf/magicked_admin.conf[/b]', for more configuration options as some features are disabled by default.

Each server managed by KF2 Magicked Admin has a config section that looks something like '[b][server_one][/b]', followed by several options ('[b]x = y[/b]'). Copy the default server section and change the name if you want to manage multiple servers. '[b][server_one][/b]' is the name of the server, this can be changed to whatever you want, but each section should have a unique name.

[h1]Options[/h1]

The following options can be configured in the config file '[b]conf/magicked_admin.conf[/b]'.
[list]
[*] '[b]address[/b]'  - Web address of the server's web admin panel. Requires scheme and protocol
    - Example: '[b]address=https://0.0.0.0:8080[/b]'

[*] '[b]username[/b]' - Web admin username to login with, this will appear in the chat when the bot has something to output. It's recommended to create a separate account for the bot.
    - Example: '[b]username=Admin[/b]'

[*] '[b]password[/b]'  - Web admin password that matches the username above.
    - Example: '[b]password=123[/b]'

[*] '[b]game_password[/b]' - Default game password to set when the password is toggled using '[b]!password <on|off>[/b]'.
    - Example: '[b]game_password=Hunter69[/b]'

[/list]

## Renaming the chatbot (multi-admin)
To rename your chatbot to something other than 'Admin' your server must be configured for multi-admin. 

If your server already has multi-admin support all you need to do is create an account with the desired name and change the account credentials in '[b]conf/magicked_admin.conf[/b]'

The following covers the same setup as the official Tripwire documentation on this topic, which is available [url=https://wiki.killingfloor2.com/index.php?title=Dedicated_Server_(Killing_Floor_2)#Setting_up_multiple_web_admins]here[/url].
[olist]
[*]Go to your server's config folder. '[b]KF2-Server\KFGame\Config\Config[/b]'.

[*]Open '[b]KFWebAdmin.ini[/b]' in your favourite editor, add the following under the '[b][WebAdmin.WebAdmin][/b]' section, and save the file.
[code]AuthenticationClass=WebAdmin.MultiWebAdminAuth[/code]

[*]Now open your web admin panel and there should be a new '[b]Administrators[/b]' section in the sidebar.
[previewicon=11679370;sizeThumb,inline;chrome_2018-03-08_23-53-58.png][/previewicon]

[*]Click '[b]Administrators[/b]' and select '[b]Create Administrator[/b]'. Enter a name for the Chatbot (This is the name you will use to sign in with). Click OK.

[*]Give it a '[b]Display Name[/b]', '[b]Password[/b]', and enable the account (the display name is what players will see in chat).
[previewicon=11679547;sizeThumb,inline;chrome_2018-03-09_00-16-09.png][/previewicon]

[*]Leave '[b]Access Order[/b]' set to '[b]Deny/Allow[/b]', and don't add any '[b]Deny Patterns[/b]' or '[b]Allow Patterns[/b]'. If you have issues using your new account, this is a common culprit so please leave it as is.

[*]Click '[b]Save[/b]' and the account is ready for use.

[*]Update the account credentials in '[b]conf/magicked_admin.conf[/b]'
[/olist]

## Endless and weekly game mode support
In game modes other than survival KF2 Magicked Admin will have a limited feature set due to differences in the web admin panel when in other modes. However the web admin panel can be altered to enable the full feature set.

For this reason a web admin patcher is available [url=https://github.com/th3-z/kf2-magicked-admin/releases/download/0.1.4/kf2-admin-patches-0.0.1.zip]here[/url]. 

[h1]Notes[/h1]
To use this utility your server files in '[b]KF2Server/KFGame/Web/ServerAdmin[/b]' will have to be stock/clean. If you have edited these files I suggest the following alternatives.
[list]
[*]Validate the server files with steamcmd with the command '[b]app_update 232130 validate[/b]' and use the patcher as normal.
[*]Manually apply the diffs in '[b]admin-patcher/patches[/b]' to your server files.
[/list]

[h1]Usage (GUI/Desktop)[/h1]
[olist]
[*] Run the executable
[*] Open the location where your server is installed in the destination selection window
[*] Click '[b]open[/b]'
[/olist]

[h1]Usage (Headless/Server)[/h1]
[*] Run the executable with a target flag, e.g. '[b]./magicked_admin.exe --target /path/to/kf2/server[/b]'
[*] Check the console window for any issues

## Configuring multiple servers
KF2 Magicked Admin can work with any amount of servers you run.

To configure more servers, find '[b]conf/magicked_admin.conf[/b]', and open it in your favourite editor.

Copy the whole '[b][server_one][/b]' section, and paste it at the end of the file. Update the '[b]address[/b]', '[b]username[/b]', and '[b]password[/b]' options.

Below is an example.
[code]
[server_one]
game_password = 123
address = http://127.0.0.1:8080
username = Admin
password = root

[server_two]
game_password = Hunter69
address = http://127.0.0.1:8081
username = Admin
password = 123
[/code]

You can do this for as many servers as you want.

## Renaming servers
If you have a few servers, you might want to name them so you can easily identify them.

You first need to open '[b]conf/magicked_admin.conf[/b]' and here you can change '[b]server_one[/b]' to anything you want.

You then need to go back and change '[b]server_one.motd[/b]' and '[b]server_one.init[/b]' to the name you just set it to in '[b]conf/magicked_admin.conf[/b]'.

## Resetting stats
To reset the scoreboard all you have to do is delete the '[b]conf/*.sqlite[/b]' file associated with the server name, a new one will be created the next time you start KF2 Magicked Admin.

If I wanted to reset the stats on '[b]server_four[/b]', I would delete the '[b]conf/server_four.sqlite[/b]' file and restart KF2 Magicked Admin.
