# Killing Floor 2 Magicked Administrator
Scripted management, statistics, and bot for ranked Killing Floor 2 servers. Provides in-game commands, player stat tracking and ranking, live MOTD scoreboard and stats, greeter, and admin functions.

* Writting a `server_name.init` with a list of commands will run the commands when the bot starts on server_name

## Dependancies/building
* Python 3.4+
* cx_freeze
* requests
* lxml
* colorama
* termcolor

build by running the provided scripts `build.bat` or `build.sh` after installing dependancies via pip.

## Minimal configuration
If running from source you will need to copy the example configs from the `config` folder to the root folder, the build scripts do this automatically.
After the cofiguration is present, edit these lines in `magicked_admin.conf` to match your server details:
```
address = 127.0.0.1:8080
username = Admin
password = 123
```

## Running
Run `python main.py` (python 3 is required!) if executing from source. If you're using a binary execute `magicked_admin.exe`.
