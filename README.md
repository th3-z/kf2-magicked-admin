Scripted management, statistics, and bot for ranked Killing Floor 2 servers. 
Provides in-game commands, player stat tracking and ranking, live MOTD 
scoreboard and stats, greeter, and admin functions. Running entirely through 
the web admin, it does not affect a server's ranked/custom status. It can be 
ran either directly on the server or remotely, and manage multiple servers at 
once.

Features
--------

### Commands

When inputting commands into the chat they need to be prefixed with `!`.
When writting commands into a script, or chaining them this should be 
omitted. 

Many commands will look for closest matches to their parameters. 
For example '_biotics_' will match '_kf-biotics-lab_' and '_userO_' will match
'_userOne™/@:®_'.

All commands have in-game help text that can be accessed with the `-h` flag.

* Example: `!commands -h`

All commands also have the following flags.

* `-q` - Suppresses output
* `-p` - Pads output to hide the username line

Escape sequences as follows are available to format messages.

* `\n` - Newline
    - Example: `!say line 0\nline 1`
* `\t` - Tab
    - Example: `!say line 0\n\tline 1 is indented`

</details>

### MOTD leaderboard

Create a `conf/server_name.motd` file containing pairs of `%PLR` and `%SCR`.
`%PLR` will be replaced with player names and `%SCR` will be replaced with
their current score. You can now use `!update_motd <type>` to draw the
leaderboard into your welcome screen, `<type>` should be kills, dosh, or time
depending on the desired score metric.

`%SRV_D` and `%SRV_K` will be replaced by the total dosh and kills on the 
server respectively.

### Scripts

Writing a `server_name.init` in the `conf/scripts` folder with a series of commands
will run the commands in sequence when the bot starts on `server_name`.

Additional scripts can be written in the `conf/scripts` folder and ran with the
`!run` command. There is an example already in there that can be ran with 
`!run example`.

* Comments can be added to scripts by prefixing a line with `;`.

### Webadmin patches

For gamemodes other than survival to function in full patches have to be
applied to the `KFGame/Web/ServerAdmin` folder on the server. For this reason
a script is provided in the `admin-patches` folder that will automatically
patch your server.

There is currently no CLI or Windows build for this component. You can run it
with `python3 admin-patches/admin-patches.py`. A dialogue box will appear
asking you to locate your server.


Configuration options
---------------------

Basic setup is done on the first run. However this does not cover all of the 
options KF2-MA can offer. Please see the config file, `conf/magicked_admin.conf`, 
for more configuration options as some features are disabled by default.

Each server managed by KF2-MA has a section that looks something like 
`[server_one]`, followed by several options (`x = y`). Copy and edit the
default server section if you want to manage multiple servers. `[server_one]`
is the name of the server, this can be changed to whatever you want.

### Options

Options can be configured in the config file `conf/magicked_admin.conf`.

* `address`
    - Web address of the server's webadmin panel. Requires scheme and protocol,
    e.g. `https://0.0.0.0:8080`
* `username`
    - Webadmin username to login with, this will appear in the chat when the 
    bot has something to output. It's recommended to create a separate account
    for the bot.
* `password`
    - Webadmin password that matches the username above.
* `game_password`
    - Default game password to set when the password is toggled using 
    `!password <on|off>`.
* `motd_scoreboard`
    - Boolean value, enable or disable the MOTD scoreboard feature. Defaults to
    disabled.
* `scoreboard_type`
    - Possible values: `kills`, or `dosh`. Change the type of scores that are
    displayed in the MOTD scoreboard.
    
Running with Docker
---------------------------

Running with docker is easy. Just issue this command:
```
    docker run -it -p 1880:1880 --name kf2-magicked-admin -v '<host config folder location>':'/magicked_admin/conf' th3z/kf2-magicked-admin
```
You will need to change `<host config folder location>` to wheverever you want
to store your config folder. `/mnt/user/appdata/kf2-magicked-admin` is a popular
choice for systems running Unraid.

After this command runs the container will exit out and the logs will tell you
to setup the config file. Go to your `conf` folder and set things up then run 
the container again and you are good to go!

If you want to use the admin_patches so that kf-magicked-admin gets installed into your server directory when the container starts (some gamemodes wont track stats without it) just mount your game directory into the container and set the `PATCHES_TARGET_DIR` env variable to the directory. You can mount multiple directories and just separate them with a comma "," in the env variable if you have many servers. Here is an example:
```
    docker run -it -p 1880:1880 --name kf2-magicked-admin -v '<host config folder location>':'/magicked_admin/conf' -v '<host kf folder>':/kf2-server -v '<host kf folder>':/kf2-server-two -e 'PATCHES_TARGET_DIR'='/kf2-server,/kf2-server-two' th3z/kf2-magicked-admin
```

Running from Python sources
---------------------------

Before contributing code you will need to install the Python requirements.

### Requirements
Examples work on Debian 10 and Ubuntu Xenial, may differ for other operating 
systems. Install the following packages.

* Python 3.7 - `apt install python3`
* Pip - `apt install python3-pip`
* Python 3 dependencies - `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
    - This might complain about cx_freeze not installing if you haven't got 
    zlib-dev, but cx_freeze is only needed for building.

### Running 
`git clone git@github.com:th3-z/kf2-magicked-admin.git`

`cd kf2-magicked-admin`  

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

`python3 -O magicked_admin/magicked_admin.py`  

The `-O` flag runs the program in release mode, remove it to run KF2-MA in 
debug mode. Debug mode will enable more detailed output.

Building
--------

You can build a binary release for distribution with `make` after installing 
both the run and build requirements. 

### Requirements
Examples work on Debian 10 and Ubuntu Xenial, may differ for other operating 
systems.

* Python 3.7 - `apt install python3`
* Pip - `apt install python3-pip`
* Pip dependencies - `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
* Make - `apt install make`
* zlib-dev - `apt install zlib1g-dev`

### Windows users
You can build the program without make by running `setup.py`.

* `python3 setup.py build`
